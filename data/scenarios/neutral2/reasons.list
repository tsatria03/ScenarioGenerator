being tired
being bord
being weird
being a nice person

opening the program
using the program
noticing a newly-released game
having no reason to exist

eating their dinner
eating their grilled cheese
eating their tomato soup

breaking their door
breaking their apple watch

stealing their blanket
stealing their truck

not playing stw with them
not playing SBYW with them
not playing screaming strike with them
not facing them in a manamon battle

anoying them
pushing them into a river
throwing them into a volcano
giving them aids
downgrading them to windows XP

shuttting down their computer
standing in front of their computer
flooding their house
stepping on their Ipad
hacking their computer
Disconnecting their life support
smashing their google pixel
