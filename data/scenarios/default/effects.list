left your milk out overnight and you drank it without checking
replaced your coffee with sawdust and now you're nauseous and sleepy
hacked your Spotify and replaced your playlists with polka remixes
switched your shampoo with glue and now your hair is rock solid
set your autocorrect to replace every word with "bees"
sent a group email from your account confessing your undying love for waffles
signed you up for a mime competition and now you're legally mute for 24 hours
installed Windows Vista on all your devices as a joke
replaced your toilet paper with sandpaper and locked the door behind you
poisoned you and you started hallucinating about llamas
poisoned you and you threw up in your shoes
poisoned you and everything around you turned green
put glitter in your socks and now everything itches permanently
slipped a banana peel under your chair and now you fear sitting
added ghost pepper to your toothpaste and now your mouth is crying
replaced your deodorant with peanut butter and bees love you
put laxatives in your protein shake and now you trust no one
gave you a tattoo while you were asleep — it says "I meow for attention"
enabled dark mode in real life and now you can't see anything
changed your GPS voice to Shrek — permanently
hid shrimp in your walls and now your house smells like betrayal
set your ringtone to their own scream and then kept calling you
added a laugh track to your life and now strangers think you’re on TV
signed you up for clown school and now you’re morally obligated to juggle
replaced all your keys with identical ones that don’t work
wrote a fanfiction about you and shared it at your family reunion
