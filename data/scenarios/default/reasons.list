were weird
were a nice person
were using this program
were standing in front of your computer
were tired
were bord

opened this program.
had no reason to exist
just noticed a newly-released game

ate dinner
ait their grilled cheese
ait their tomato soup

stole their blanket
stole a truck

broke their door
broke their apple watch

shut down your computer
flooded their house
stepped on their Ipad
anoyed them
pushed them into a river
threw them into a volcano
hacked someone's computer
Disconnected their life support
gave them aids
smashed their google pixel
downgraded them to windows XP

wouldn't play stw with them
wouldn't play SBYW with them
wouldn't play screaming strike with them
wouldn't face them in a manamon battle
