being tired
being bord
being weird
being a nice person

opening this program
using this program
noticing a newly-released game
having no reason to exist

not playing stw with him
not playing SBYW with him
not playing screaming strike with him
not facing him in a manamon battle

anoying him
pushing him into a river
throwing him into a volcano
giving him aids
downgrading him to windows XP

eating his dinner
eating his grilled cheese
eating his tomato soup

stealing his blanket
stealing his truck

breaking his apple watch
breaking his door

shutting down his computer
standing in front of his computer
flooding his house
stepping on his Ipad
hacking his computer
Disconnecting his life support
smashing his google pixel
