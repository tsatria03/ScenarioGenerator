left your milk out overnight and you drank it without checking
replaced your coffee with sawdust and now you're nauseous and sleepy
glued a Whoopee Cushion to your pants â€” everyone at work thinks you're disgusting
hacked your Spotify and replaced your playlists with polka remixes
switched your shampoo with glue and now your hair is rock solid
set your autocorrect to replace every word with "bees"
sent a group email from your account confessing your undying love for waffles
signed you up for a mime competition and now you're legally mute for 24 hours
installed Windows Vista on all your devices as a joke
replaced your toilet paper with sandpaper and locked the door behind you
